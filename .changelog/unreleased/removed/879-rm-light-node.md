* `[tendermint-light-node]` We removed the `light-node` crate from the repo since
  nobody's currently really using it. If anyone needs please log an issue and
  we'll restore it. It will, of course, remain accessible in the
  [repo history](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/tree/f207ecc0a7c071a54d63f159794b16a216741b38)
  for now.
